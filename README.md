### Hello, World of AI and Data Science! ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I'm deeply immersed in completing my Master's in Artificial Intelligence. Alongside my academic pursuits, I'm currently working on a fascinating project: developing a scorecard estimation model using logistic regression classifiers. This project focuses on analyzing the HMEQ dataset, which includes data on 5,960 home equity loans, providing insights into borrower characteristics and delinquency rates.
- ðŸŒ±Enhancing my skills as a Quantitative Analyst, I'm currently exploring a variety of key areas and tools crucial to this field. This includes advanced statistical analysis techniques such as Monte Carlo simulations and Bayesian inference, which are fundamental in risk assessment and decision-making processes. Additionally, I'm deepening my proficiency in Python, particularly with libraries like NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn and TensorFlow, which are essential for data manipulation and machine learning tasks. I'm also familiarizing myself with SQL for efficient data querying and R for more specialized statistical analyses. Lastly, I'm delving into machine learning algorithms, focusing on their application in financial modeling and predictive analytics.
- ðŸ‘¯ Seeking collaboration opportunities! I'm eager to contribute to a significant Machine Learning project in the finance sector, particularly one that navigates the complexities of time series data.
